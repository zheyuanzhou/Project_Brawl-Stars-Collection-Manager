  cardHistory: The <size=64>Maiden</size> of Anguish and Mistress of All Evil (voiced
    by Lani Minella) is the only female of the Great Evils. Andariel appears as a
    large, feminine demon, not unlike the succubi of the first game, and is the final
    battle of Act I of Diablo II. According to her backstory, despite taking part
    in the banishment of the Prime Evils, she followed Diablo to Sanctuary and wished
    to gain his favor by guarding the way east, so that Diablo can free his brother
    without interference. The heroes who set out in pursuit of Diablo confront Andariel
    deep in the corrupted monastery of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye, which
    guarded the passes between Khanduras and the eastern deserts of Aranoch.
