  cardHistory: Rakanoth, the Lord of <size=64>Despair</size>, served Andariel, the
    Maiden of Anguish, with efficient brutality, for his touch may open up many painful
    wounds. He was also the warden of Izual during many long years that the angel
    suffered in Rakanoth's own Plains of Despair, but he has quit his realm unexpectedly
    in recent times. He captured and tortured Auriel, Archangel of Hope, during the
    events of Diablo III in order to break Heaven's will to drive back Diablo's hellish
    minions.
