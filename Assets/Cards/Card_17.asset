  cardHistory: The Witch Doctor is a much more active, spell-attacking class than
    the Necromancer was, though. A Witch Doctor can not succeed just summoning pets
    and sitting back; he must venture in much closer to the fray, constantly using
    attack spells to supplement the damage dealt by various short-lived pets.
