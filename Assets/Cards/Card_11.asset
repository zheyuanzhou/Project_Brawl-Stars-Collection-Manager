  cardHistory: Diablo, the Lord of <size=64>Terror</size> (voiced by Bill Roper, later
    by JB Blanc), is the titular character and main antagonist of the game series.
    He is also the youngest and most powerful of the three Prime Evils. Diablo and
    his elder brothers Mephisto and Baal ruled over Hell as a sovereign triumvirate
    until overthrown by the Lesser Evils Azmodan and Belial, who banished the Prime
    Evils to the mortal world of Sanctuary. However, Diablo's game manual implies
    that the "Dark Exile", as this became known, was in fact intended by the Prime
    Evils in order to corrupt the mortal world <size=48>personally</size>.
