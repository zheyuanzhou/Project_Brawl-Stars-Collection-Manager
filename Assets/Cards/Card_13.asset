  cardHistory: The Paladin, Templar, and Crusader are all from different branches
    of the Zakarum faith. The Zakarum itself is a series of teachings from Akarat,
    the founder of this religion. Very little is known of Akarat himself, as after
    he spread his teachings in Kehjistan, he ventured into the east and was never
    seen again. The worship comes from embodying a series of ideals rather than the
    belief in a centralized deity.
