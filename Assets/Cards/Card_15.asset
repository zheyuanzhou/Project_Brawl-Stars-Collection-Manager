  cardHistory: In Diablo II the Amazon was the archer character, though it was possible
    to use a bow with some success with a few other character builds. Bow-devoted
    Amazons were commonly called "bowazons" and they specialized entirely in archery,
    though hybrid 'zons were also popular, mixing some spear or javelin skills in
    with the archery.
