  cardHistory: Baal, the Lord of <size=64>Destruction</size> (voiced by Milton James)
    is the main antagonist of Lord of Destruction, the expansion to Diablo II. Baal
    was the second of the Prime Evils to be captured; a group of Horadrim under the
    venerable mage Tal Rasha hunted him down into the deserts of Aranoch. The Horadrim
    managed to defeat him, but during the encounter, Baal's destructive nature shattered
    the <size=48>Soulstone</size> that was to be his prison. It was during this moment
    that Tal Rasha stepped forward.
